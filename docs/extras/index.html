      <p>
        <b>Winner of the Lawyerist 2016 Short Fiction Contest.</b> Written well before the Supreme Court's overruling of Roe v Wade, we we visit the United States as it celebrates its tricentennial. Human life extension has been perfected. Roe is but a distant memory, and a case before the Supreme Court is poised to ask, what is the meaning of <i>life</i>.

        "She remembered the elation among her cohorts at conquering aging. She also remembered how short-lived the high was and how quickly a nation came to understand the concept of inelastic demand. There was no limit to what people would pay. After all, the benefits were transgenerational, since [they were] passed from mother to child. It laid bare the gulf between the haves and the have-nots. For the first time in human history, the rich really were a different breed."

      <p>
         It's 2041 and driverless cars have eliminated traffic tickets. How will policing survive? In this tale of unintended consequences, I use our relationship with the car to interrogate modern policing along with the interplay of digital surveillance and over criminalization.

        "Danielle remembered a time when her parents drove, but they shared the roads with autonomous taxis and long-haul trucks. By the time she was old enough to get her driver’s license, owning a manual car didn’t make financial sense. She didn’t need one to get around, and insurance for human drivers was astronomical. There was no question. The world had become a better place. Pre-automation, tens of thousands died every year in what people euphemistically called accidents. Distracted, tired or otherwise impaired people; that’s what caused those accidents. Today, annual traffic fatalities numbered in the hundreds."
